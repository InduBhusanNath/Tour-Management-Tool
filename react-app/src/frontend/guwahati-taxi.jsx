                                         <p>
                                            The Umananda island is one of the best places to visit in Guwahati. Notably, it is the smallest river island in the world. Umananda is also a key component of Guwahati tourism.

                                            The island stands on the river Brahmaputra, flowing across the city. Being the smallest island does not mean it is devoid of human activities. Instead, Umananda attracts foreign tourists and other people. As such, it receives significant footfalls regularly.

                                         <p>

                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                             North Guwahati has many things to do. The options include sightseeing, engaging in spirituality, and picnicking. Due to the broad range of activity options, North Guwahati is one of the best places to visit in Guwahati.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                            Centuries-old temples can give a glimpse of the richness of construction technology during the ancient days.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                            Temples in North Guwahati were built by kings who ruled during the 17th and 18th centuries. As such, the temples are more than three hundred years old.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>

                                            Ferries run to and from North Guwahati at frequent intervals. That can be an exciting experience due to the sight of the banks and the river.

                                            Besides, the ropeway can be another exciting option for commuting to and from North Guwahati.
